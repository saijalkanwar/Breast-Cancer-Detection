# Breast-Cancer-Detection
# ðŸ©º Breast Cancer Detection using Machine Learning

This project uses machine learning algorithms to detect whether a breast tumor is **benign** or **malignant** based on various diagnostic features. It leverages the **Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Dataset** from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

# ðŸ“Š Dataset

- **Source:** [UCI ML Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Breast+Cancer+Wisconsin+(Diagnostic))
- **Instances:** 569
- **Features:** 30 real-valued input features + 1 target (Diagnosis: M or B)
- **Classes:**
  - `M` = Malignant (cancerous)
  - `B` = Benign (non-cancerous)

#ðŸ§  Algorithms Used

- Logistic Regression
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Random Forest
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Decision Tree

# ðŸ“Œ Features Used

Each cell nucleus has the following 10 characteristics, computed in three forms (mean, standard error, worst):

- Radius
- Texture
- Perimeter
- Area
- Smoothness
- Compactness
- Concavity
- Concave points
- Symmetry
- Fractal dimension

# ðŸ§ª Model Evaluation Metrics

- Accuracy
- Precision
- Confusion Matrix
- ROC Curve
